When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
COVID_on_TikTok <- read.csv("/Users/sanch/Desktop/BIS15W2025_group13/Sanchari/tiktok_data_open.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
summary(COVID_on_TikTok)
```

```{r}
glimpse(COVID_on_TikTok)
```
```{r}
names(COVID_on_TikTok)
```
